Cda's Morph Add-on brings you the morph mod from Java Edition over to Bedrock
Edition. You can currently morph into any hostile mob as listed by MC Gamepedia

THIS ADD-ON IS IN ALPHA AND MAY BE BUGGY THIS ADD-ON REQUIRES "HOLIDAY CREATOR
FEATURES" TO BE ENABLED

Please also note this add-on modifies the Vanilla Player Files, which means
many packs will not be compatible with this

Some mobs are hidden due to many bugs as listed below

WIP Reasons:
Blaze - Only renders head and 1 'leg'
Elder Guardian - Doesn't render spikes correctly
Ghast - Visual size too small
Guardian - Doesn't render spikes correctly
Silverfish - Most of body renders incorrectly
Slime - Doesn't render like it's supposed to, looks more solid than it should
Stray - Doesn't render with outer layer
Vex - Oversized
Zombie Villager - Doesn't render with outer layer

You can still unlock these by running "/event entity @s cda002:remove", followed
by "/event entity @s cda002:" and then one of the mobs listed above, replacing
spaces with underscores _ and converting to lowercase. For example, to access
the Elder Guardian, run:
1. /event entity @s cda002:remove
2. /event entity @s elder_guardian

Known Issues:
Lack of movement animations

Held items may render in the wrong spot
Mobs like zombie won't hold out their arms
Magma Cube/Slime can only be baby size
Ravagers do not break blocks
Weird crouching animation
Husks drop zombie morph instead of husk morph
Piglin brutes don't drop morph
Vexes don't drop morph
Zombie villagers drop zombie morph instead of zombie villager morph
