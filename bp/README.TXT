Notice: It is possible that some mobs may break worlds. Use with caution, an extensive test world is recommended. I am not responsible for any issues.

Cda's Morph Add-on brings you the morph mod from Java Edition over to Bedrock Edition. You can currently morph into any hostile mob as listed by MC Gamepedia

THIS ADD-ON IS IN ALPHA AND MAY BE BUGGY

Please also note this add-on modifies the Vanilla Player Files, which means
many packs will not be compatible with this

Some mobs are hidden due to many bugs as listed below

WIP Reasons - https://github.com/cda94581/Community_Collabs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%E2%9A%A0+Bug%22+label%3A%22%F0%9F%A7%9F%E2%80%8D%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F+Cda%27s+Morph+Add-on%22
#20 Most of Silverfish body renders incorrectly
#80 Chicken renders incorrectly
#81 Ender Dragon renders incorrectly

You can still unlock these by running "/function cda002/", followed
by one of the mobs listed above, replacing
spaces with underscores _ and converting to lowercase. For example, to access
the Silverfish, run:
1. /function cda002/silverfish
