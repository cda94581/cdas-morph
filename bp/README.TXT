Cda's Morph Add-on brings you the morph mod from Java Edition over to Bedrock Edition. You can currently morph into any hostile mob as listed by MC Gamepedia

THIS ADD-ON IS IN ALPHA AND MAY BE BUGGY

Please also note this add-on modifies the Vanilla Player Files, which means
many packs will not be compatible with this

Some mobs are hidden due to many bugs as listed below

WIP Reasons - https://github.com/cda94581/Community_Collabs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%E2%9A%A0+Bug%22+label%3A%22%F0%9F%A7%9F%E2%80%8D%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F+Cda%27s+Morph+Add-on%22
#16 Blaze only renders head and 1 'leg'
#25 Blaze doesn't render
#17 Elder Guardian doesn't render spikes correctly
#18 Ghast visual size too small
#19 Guardian doesn't render spikes correctly
#20 Most of Silverfish body renders incorrectly
#23 Vex oversized
#24 Zombie Villager doesn't render with outer layer

You can still unlock these by running "/function cda002/", followed
by one of the mobs listed above, replacing
spaces with underscores _ and converting to lowercase. For example, to access
the Elder Guardian, run:
1. /function cda002/elder_guardian

#8 Mobs like zombie won't hold out their arms
#9 Magma Cube/Slime can only be baby size
