## Introduction
**This Add-on is in BETA, and there will be bugs**

Cdaâ€™s Morph Add-on brings the popular Java Edition Morph Mod onto Bedrock Edition! This currently supports all the mobs as stated by Minecraft Gamepedia, minus the Ender Dragon. You are able to morph into mobs and take their appearance and more using items that you can either craft or get by killing a mob.

## Documentation
Please note that I am fully, 100% aware of many issues. I am working on fixing them. For a question like "It doesn't work", (because it works) check the troubleshooting section. If you have issues with that, then [contact me](../about#links). For something that you think is a bug, report it on [GitHub](https://github.com/cda94581/Community_Collabs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%E2%9A%A0+Bug%22+label%3A%22%F0%9F%A7%9F%E2%80%8D%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F+Cda%27s+Morph+Add-on%22) if it hasn't already been reported.

This add-on allows you to **morph** into any mob. With this add-on you have at your disposal 71 different mobs **Morph** items that you may use to morph into the mobs, as well as an item to morph back into your regular **Player**.

Please note that from version 0.0.7 and onwards, using the morph items is different. Previously, you would just **USE** the item, whether that be right-click or similar. <span style="background-color: #FDFD77">**Now**, you must **SNEAK & JUMP**</span> while holding the item.

You also have 1 **WIP** mob, the Ender Dragon.

Please note, many packs will **<span style="background-color: #FDFD77;">not</span>** work with this, as it modifies the **<span style="background-color: #FDFD77;">Vanilla Player Files</span>**.

You can also toggle if you want to only be able to obtain by **crafting**, by **killing**, by **both**, or have **no way** to obtain. **You MUST select one of these, or the pack will not work**. To do so, go into your world behavior packs. Tap on it, then tap the **gear** icon. Then, drag the slider to the appropriate one you would like. Options:
- **Left** - No Way to Obtain in Survival
- **Left Center** - Only Recipes
- **Right Center** - Only Loot Tables
- **Right** - Recipes & Loot Tables

**To obtain the WIP Mob**:

Run **"/function cda002/"**, followed by one of the **WIP** mobs, replacing spaces with **Underscores** \_ and **converting to lowercase**. For example, to access the **Ender Dragon**, run:

1. /function cda002/ender_dragon

Please note that there is a reason that the Ender Dragon is marked as WIP, and that I am working on bringing it out.

**Troubleshooting**

If your pack won't work, the information below may help. Additional information can be found in the Pinned Comments on MCPEDL or YouTube.
- Make sure that when you apply the Behavior Pack, you choose a subpack.
	- Note that this *should* automatically happen if you apply the Behavior Pack first, however always double check.
- Make sure both the Resource Pack and Behavior Pack is applied.
- This pack might not be compatible with other packs.
- Cheats might need to be enabled (testing required).
- Before 0.0.6, make sure you're on version 1.16.201+
- As of 0.0.6, make sure you're on version 1.17.0+
- As of 0.0.7, make sure you're on version 1.17.10+
- As of 0.0.8, make sure you're on version 1.18.0+
- As of 0.1.0, make sure you're on version 1.18.10+
- Before 0.0.3, make sure "Holiday Creator Features" is enabled.
- Contact me! I highly recommend using [these links](../about#links) as I can more easily receive notifications and as such, help more.

## Installation
1. Download the pack at the given link
2. Import it
	- If you are unable to import it with a tap/double click, rename the file from a **.mcaddon** file extension to a **.zip** file extension. Afterwards, **unzip** the folder and move the **behavior pack** to the **behavior\_packs** folder and the **resource pack** to the **resource\_packs** folder of the **com.mojang** folder
3. Apply it to your worlds
4. Enjoy!
